🌌 Cipherverse: An Interactive Cipher Tool
Cipherverse is a web-based application designed for learning, practicing, and having fun with classic cryptographic ciphers. It combines a user-friendly cipher tool with a gamified challenge mode to make the world of secret codes accessible and engaging for everyone.

This project was built to be both an educational playground and a test of your decryption skills, all wrapped in a sleek, customizable UI.

✨ Key Features
Interactive Cipher Tool: Encrypt and decrypt messages instantly using three classic ciphers:

Caesar Cipher: Simple substitution with a customizable shift.

Vigenère Cipher: A more advanced method using a secret keyword.

Polybius Square: Converts letters to number coordinates.

Cipher Chaining: Combine the Caesar and Vigenère ciphers to create more complex encrypted messages.

Gamified Challenge Mode: Race against a timer to decrypt a message and earn points. Hints are available, but they come at a cost!

Dynamic UI: Switch between different visual themes (Dark Matter, Neo Retro, Forest Glitch) to personalize your experience.

Starfield Background: An animated background adds to the futuristic, cyber-themed aesthetic.
